Lists, well, list multiple things. Lists work well for one-dimensional categories. When
you want to list things in two dimensions, choose a table instead. There are three basic
category of lists.

---------------
Unordered lists
---------------

Choose an unordered, or bulleted, list, when the order of items do not matter.

- item a
- item b
- item c

Ordered lists

Choose an ordered list, when the order of the items matter, that is, in most cases you
need to perform the second step *after* the first step, and so on.

#. Step 1
#. Step 2

Definition lists

A nice way of describing categories is via definition lists. Think of it as an unordered
list with additional explanations to each item.

Term a
   Definition for term a

Term b
   Definition for term b
