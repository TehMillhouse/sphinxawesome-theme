Installing the theme as a Python package
========================================

If you just want to use the theme,
install it as a Python package.

Installing a release version (recommended)
------------------------------------------

.. highlight:: console

Install a released version
from the Python Package Index (PyPI_)::

    $ pip install sphinxawesome-theme

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sphinxawesome-theme/

Installing from GitHub
----------------------

If you need to use the latest features,
install the theme directly from GitHub::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/kai687/sphinxawesome-theme.git

Check the "MASTER" section in the CHANGELOG_ file.
These features are available in the GitHub version,
but not yet in the released version on PyPI_.

.. _CHANGELOG: https://github.com/kai687/sphinxawesome-theme/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst
