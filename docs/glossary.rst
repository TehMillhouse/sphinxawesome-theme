      `GitHub documentation <https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`__.

   forking a repository
      Create a remote copy of a remote GitHub repository
      under your GitHub user account.

      This allows you to make modifications without affecting the original project.
      If you want to suggest merging your changes with the original project,
      you can create a
      `Pull request <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`_.

   upstream
      The upstream repository is the original project,
      which you forked to create your own copy.
      In this documentation, upstream refers to the
      repository at
      https://github.com/kai687/sphinxawesome-theme.git

   theme
      A theme is a bundle of HTML templates,
      CSS styles, and JavaScript files
      that work together to create the user interface
      of the website -- the “look and feel”.
      You can alter the theme of a Sphinx website
      simply by making a configuration change.
